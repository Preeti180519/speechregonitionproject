To train the speech synthesis models we need a dataset consisting of thousands of pairs of audio clips and their transcriptions. Extracting audio clips from recordings is easy. The difficult part is matching each audio clip to its transcript. Even in cases when we already have an accurate transcript, as it is with audiobooks, the process of manually matching each audio clip to its corresponding text is tedious and time consuming.

A workaround is to use an automatic speech transcription service to transcribe each audio clip. The benefits of this is that the process is automatic and it only takes a few hours, the downside is that the transcription will not be 100% accurate. My expectation was that even if the transcription was not perfect that it would be good enough to get convincing results.
